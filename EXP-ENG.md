# Project Summary: Zuber Ride-Sharing Analysis (Chicago)

**Objective: Identify passenger preferences and weather impact on taxi trips to optimize Zuber's launch strategy.**

- Data Sources: Analyzed Chicago taxi trips (November 2017), weather records, and neighborhood data from SQL databases and CSV files.

-Key Findings:

    -Top companies: Flash Cab (most trips) and Taxi Affiliation Services dominated the market.

    -"Yellow"/"Blue" taxi companies accounted for 30% of trips in early November.

    - Weather Impact: Compared trip durations from Loop to O'Hare on rainy vs. clear Saturdays using CASE statements.

-Python Analysis:

    - Visualized top 10 dropoff neighborhoods (River North led) and company trip volumes.

    - Processed project_sql_result_01.csv and project_sql_result_04.csv with Pandas/Matplotlib.
 
    - Hypothesis Test: Used t-test (Œ±=0.05) on project_sql_result_07.csv to confirm rainy Saturdays increased trip durations by 15%.

- SQL Skills: Joined trips and weather_records via timestamp, grouped/aggregated data, and filtered NULL values.

- Visualizations: Created bar charts for company rankings and neighborhood dropoff hotspots.

- Conclusion: Recommended surge pricing during bad weather and partnerships with top taxi companies.

- Tools: SQL (JOIN, GROUP BY, CASE), Python (Pandas, SciPy, Matplotlib), and data cleaning.

**Achievement: Delivered actionable insights to enhance Zuber's competitive edge. üöñüåßÔ∏è**
